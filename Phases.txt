Phase 1:
*Customers:
    Random number of patrons 3 - 10
    drink until happiness drops below 0
    random happiness 1 - 10
    random stinginess 1 - 3
    preferred drink is calculated by drinkPref / totalOfAllDrinkPrefs

*Calculations for happiness
    profit percent is calculated by (priceOfItem / standardPriceOfItem) - 1.25
        //Meaning 25% margin is 0 no matter what stinginess
    totalStingy = itemProfit% * stinginess
    happiness = happiness - (1 + totalStingy)
    if happiness is above -5 (drink like normal and see if happiness is above 0 and repeat)
    if happiness is below -5 (don't drink)
        //if customer didn't get 1 drink (normally because price too high) they leave angrily

Phase 2:
*Customers:
    Build a static population of 1,000 people
    Each person should have a schedule of when they "might" visit based on a calender
    Their visit should be influenced by past visits (positive or negative)
    They will look for 1 meal and continuous drinks based on happiness
    Each customer gets a drinktype, foodtype, and a profession
